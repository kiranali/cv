                <p><em> Founder and CEO of <strong> <a href="https://www.artemistech.com">Artemis Technologies</a>
                        </strong> - Best
                        Shopify/Digital Media Agency in the

                <p> I üíñ reading, ranbir kapoor and rambling but not necessary in the same order</p>
                <p>Born with ideas that were too non-conforming for the orhtodx environment of Pakistan in the 80's
                    and 90's life has been a roller coaster ride of mixed identities and priorites. Innate love for all
                    things
                    geek
                    made me decide to pursue the career of a developer which I eventually stopped doing and being since
                    2010. Fast
                    forward
                    9 years and absolute depression and misery, I have decided to go back to what I loved : Programming.
                </p>
                <p>There is no need to conform to what other people think what is best for me. I think at 40 I have
                    realised
                    this is
                    the only
                    life I am getting so I better spend the time doing what makes me feel fulfilled.</p>
